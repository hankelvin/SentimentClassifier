# SentimentClassifier

For my capstone, I chose to work on sentiment classification of Twitter posts. This was driven by two main factors. Firstly, almost every brand or company has intangible value in their reputation and a large part of the conversation affecting the reputation of brands and companies take place on social media today. Secondly, I thought this would be a nice way to get a good understanding of natural language processing as Twitter posts in particular present a unique challenge in NLP. This is given the informal nature of writing (typos, slang and colloquilism). Given these challenges, I set out with the objective to reach a 65% accuracy in labelling the sentiment of tweets.
